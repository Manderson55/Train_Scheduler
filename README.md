# Train_Scheduler# 

### Overview

This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data for the trains. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. It will also provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Instructions
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * The app will calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.
